### ğŸ“„ manim/plugins/import_plugins.py
```python
â¬œ 9      __all__ = []
â¬œ 10     
â¬œ 11     
ğŸŸ© 12     '''
ğŸŸ© 13     This code is loading all the plugins that are specified in the plugins requested
ğŸŸ© 14     list The code then iterates through each entry point and loads it into a variable
ğŸŸ© 15     called loaded plugin If loaded plugin is an instance of Module Type then we know
ğŸŸ© 16     that this plugin has been imported as a module so we can just import it with its
ğŸŸ© 17     name.
ğŸŸ© 18     New little change in the comment
ğŸŸ© 19     '''
â¬œ 20     plugins_requested: list = config["plugins"]
â¬œ 21     if "" in plugins_requested:
